# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I dedicated project0 to be an introduction to myself and what I ultimately hope to achieve in this course, building a web-app for an interest project of mine called Trekzi.

Requirements:

Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.

Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.

Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.

# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I dedicated project0 to be an introduction to myself and what I ultimately hope to achieve in this course, building a web-app for an interest project of mine called Trekzi.

The static folder contains styles.scss file and the compiled css and css.map file.
The assests folder contains images to be used in webpages.
index.html serves as the homepage.
about.html contains some of my information.
tedx.html documents my TEDx event.
trekzi.html outlines my ultimate goal in the course!
